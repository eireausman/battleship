The objective of this project was to write some TDD scripts.

Writing these before introducing any function interactions and any DOM dev was hugely beneficial. It made the DOM work especially straightforward, as the required functionality had already been proven to work, so the DOM work was compartmentalised.

The interface is very simple currently, as the focus was on the TDD work in this project.

What I aim to do is work on the next projects in the syllabus and then at a later date, when I've completely forgotten about the code included here, come back to this code and try to improve the interface. This will be a bit of a real-world test as coming back to old code is common and will therefore be a useful exercise.
